- 👋 Hi, I’m @Brahmaswaroop
- ✌️ I am an undergraduate at Victoria College, pursuing a CS Degree.
- 👀 I’m interested in Learning how to program, also I am a big time Anime watcher.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, which by the way is not as simple as everyone says it is due to its large set of libraries but i am making progress.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner projects, as i am only learning the basics, I may ask lots of things about i don't understand but please bear with me.
